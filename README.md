# glocsy

This test site contains a Hugo website using the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) documentation theme, combined with a barebones replication of the custom [glossary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true) functionality implemented by the Kubernetes website.

The glossary functionality has been updated to support the latest Bootstrap 5 version used by Docsy and may include further trimming to support smaller usecases.

Internationalisation has also been removed to dial down the complexity and make it easier to grok which changes have been made on top of the base Docsy functionality.
